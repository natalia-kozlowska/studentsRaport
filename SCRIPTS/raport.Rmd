## INTRODUCTION

<div style="text-align: justify">
We often wonder what may actually affect the outcome of final school exams. As a rule, we come to the conclusion that one of the aspects that may significantly affect the assessment is primarily the time spent on learning. And it certainly is, in a way, a good lead for our search. However, I was wondering if something else, not strictly related to science, could contribute to obtaining, at least a few additional points for the test.


It seems to me that the data analysis from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams) may at least in some way answer my question. It contains `r length (unique (student))` unique items from which we can find out not only what results were obtained by individual students from the three final exams (writing, reading and math) but also which students used the option of financing lunches, or what education their parents have.

Answering the question about what other factors may have directly or indirectly influenced the final result of the exams at school, I will focus mainly on those on which the student has no greater influence, such as the above-mentioned education of parents or, for example, belonging to a particular ethnic group . Can analyzing these variables, at least to some extent, answer the question of whether the variables that are not directly influenced by the student can, to some extent, affect the results of the final exams? 

If you are interested in what conclusions you came to when analyzing this data, I invite you to read it!

### But first, median

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

At the beginning of the analysis, we will focus on what we are most interested in, i.e. the final exam results. Perhaps already at this stage, we will be able to answer some important questions, such as *which test went best for students? *, or *did the results of one of the three exact-subject tests differ significantly from the rest? *.

I would like to emphasize that in this particular case, instead of the average, I will use the median to describe our exam results. This is because the distribution of all test results is left diagonal.

### Women rules
<div style="text-align: justify">

Let us consider for a moment whether the back could somehow significantly affect the results of the final study? It is not known that, according to the rules of women better in the humanities, for men they achieve better results in science. Can we expect any results from this data? To find out about it, we will analyze the charts below.

gridExtra::grid.arrange(x, y, z, 
           ncol = 3, 
           nrow = 1)
```

Let's also compare the overall averages of all three exams for both sexes.

```{r}
x <- student %>% 
filter(gender == 'female') %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = exsams_avg)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, fill = "#5b76eb", 
                 color = "#e9ecef", alpha =.8) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 20)) +  
  ggtitle("Average for female") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust =.5, size = 10),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#d5e8e7")
        ) +
  labs(y = "n", 
       x = NULL) 

y <- student %>% 
filter(gender == 'male') %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = exsams_avg)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, fill = "#5b76eb", 
                 color = "#e9ecef", alpha =.8) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 100, by = 20)) +  
  ggtitle("Average for male") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust =.5, size = 10),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#d5e8e7")
        ) +
  labs(y = NULL, 
       x = NULL) 

gridExtra::grid.arrange(x, y, 
           ncol = 2, 
           nrow = 1)
```

<div style="text-align: justify">

What is interesting in the charts above? The fact is that women, compared to men, coped with the exams much better. However, it was also among women that the lowest marks appeared (the average of all three exams in this group was only 9 points!), And among men the result was over 200% higher (23 points). So we can say that taking into account women in general, they were definitely better than men, but in a situation in which we analyze individual cases, we notice that it was men who passed the exams better, and they certainly did not do worse than women.

Let's check the overall statistics for both sexes. In this case, I take into account the average of all three exams, due to the normal distribution of this variable.

| Gender | Min. | 1st Qu. | Median | Mean | 3rd Qu. | Max. | 
|:------:|:-----:|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|:-----:|
| female |  9.00 | 60.67  | 70.33  | 69.57| 78.67  | 100.00 | 
| male   | 23.00 | 56.00  | 66.33  | 65.84| 76.25  | 100.00 |


After a preliminary analysis of the charts and general statistics, we can now come to some interesting conclusions. Women generally fared better on the tests. What should be noted is that our preliminary hypothesis that men might do better in math exams was true! Women were, on average, 5 points worse than men. However, I would like to emphasize that the difference is not that big, especially if we compare the next two exams with each other. The chart below will definitely help us analyze this problem.

In the case of the type of case, the differences are really noticeable and as we can see, women in practically each of the exams scored more points. Let's see if there is any significant difference between the women who wrote the test best and those who wrote it the worst.

For women who obtained the highest scores and graduated from school with an average of over 97 points, most of them passed complete tests, and only two out of ten benefited from lunches. One thing that is obvious is that among the best pupils we will not find anyone from the B and C group, and these races are among the worst results.

As we can see, the women who obtained the lowest exam results are additionally characterized by the fact that none of them passed the test completely. Additionally, each of them used the option to subsidize the dinner. It should also be noted that parents of persons with the lowest average did not have higher education.

Let's check what the situation looks like among men.

LOWEST AVERAGE (less than 25 points) FROM THREE EXAMS AMONG MEN
```{r}
student %>% 
  filter(gender == 'male') %>% 
  filter(exsams_avg < 25) %>%

<div style="text-align: justify">

Although, as we can see, this group is not as numerous as that of women,
this and on the basis of this we can draw some conclusions and notice significant differences between the two groups. Men with the highest average, like women, have well-educated parents. Additionally, each of them passed a complete test. And only one in three benefited from food subsidies. Interestingly, each of them obtained a set of points from the math exam. When it comes to the group with the lowest scores, we'll notice for sure that none of these people failed the competent test and all of them benefited from a lunch refund.

We can certainly state now that not only the back can have a significant impact on the final results of the examinations. Both whether lunch was reimbursed and the education and training of the parents may also contribute to the results obtained.

### Tell me, where are you from?

<div style="text-align: justify">

Let's think about, for example, the distribution of exam results, due to the differentiation of all ethnic groups?

</div>
```{r}
student %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = race, y = exsams_avg)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = race), width = 0.7) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point",colour = "darkred", size = 1) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = meanFunction, geom="text", size = 3.5, vjust = 1.3) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  ggtitle("Grade average for all exams by ethnicity") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust =.5, size = 10),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#d4f2c2"),
    legend.position="none"
    ) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL) 
```
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align: justify">

As we can see, group E did the best in the exam. However, let us note that in this particular case we took into account the average of all three exams! Let's check if any of the groups differs in any particular way when it comes to the result of each of the exams separately.

</div>
```{r}
student %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = math_score, group = race, fill = race)) +
  geom_density(alpha =.8) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")+
  ggtitle("Maths exam scores by ethnicity") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust =.5, size = 10),
    legend.position="bottom",
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#d4f2c2")
    ) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL) 
```
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align: justify">

If we were to compare the results of all three tests, we would conclude that there is no major difference between the groups. However, by analyzing the density plots, I wanted to carefully analyze the math test results for each ethnic group. As we already know, the test result is mainly influenced by whether the test was complete and whether the student used the lunch option. I decided to check and calculate the percentage of presence of each of this variable. However, I focused only on three groups, which to a large extent stand out from the rest.

| Race    | Gender - female | Lunch - free  | 
|:-------:|:---------------:|:-------------:|
| group A  |  40%           | 40%  | 
| group B  |  57%           | 36%  | 
| group E  |  49%           | 29%  | 

As we can see, the group that scored the best in math has the lowest percentage of people who used the free lunches option. On the other hand, group B, which has a large 'tail' on the left side, also has the largest number of women who belong to this group. As you can see, by analyzing one graph, we can easily explain some dependencies.


Since we know what the average of all three exams looks like, then let's check how each group did on each of the exams separately.

</div>
```{r}

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align: justify">

It is certainly noticeable that group E dominates other groups when it comes to the mean. On the other hand, group A is the worst in the list.

<div style="text-align: justify">

Let us note that in group B there is the greatest response from parents with secondary education, which may also, in a sense, explain the results of the math test that I analyzed earlier.

</div>

### Parental generation

<div style="text-align: justify">
Let us put the topic of gender and ethnic groups aside. We know that both of these variables could have significantly influenced the results of final exams in students, so let's check if the same applies to parents' education. In a sense, we have already answered this question by analyzing and comparing the students who received the highest and the lowest averages. We could have made a certain hypothesis that the higher the parents' education, the higher the student's score. Let's check carefully if this can really be the case.

At the beginning, let's check which education occurs most often among the parents of students.

</div>
```{r}
student %>% 
group_by(parental_education) %>%
count() %>% 
summarise(sum_edu = sum(n)) %>% 
mutate(parental_education = fct_reorder(parental_education, desc(sum_edu))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = parental_education, y = sum_edu, fill = parental_education)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", alpha =.8, width =.8) +
  geom_text(aes(label = sum_edu), vjust = 1.6, color = "white", size = 5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cols2) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  ggtitle("Parental education") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust =.5, size = 10),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#d1e6f0"),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, 
                               vjust =.5, hjust = 1)
    ) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL)
```
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="text-align: justify">

Now let's check what the mean distribution of all three exams looked like, taking into account the parents' education.

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
```{r}
student %>%
group_by(parental_education) %>%
summarise(mean_m = mean(exsams_avg)) %>% 
mutate(parental_education = fct_reorder(parental_education, desc(mean_m))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = parental_education, y = mean_m, fill = parental_education)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", alpha =.8, width =.8) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(mean_m, digits = 1)), 
            vjust = 1.6, color = "white", size = 5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cols3) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  ggtitle("Dependence of parents' education on the result of test") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust =.5, size = 10),
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, 
                               vjust =.5, hjust = 1)) +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#d1e6f0")
  ) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL) 
```
<div style="text-align: justify">

As we can see, the difference between the average of all three exams between the highest (master's degree) and the lowest (high school) is 10.5 points! Let's consider if something could be causing such a large difference between these extreme results. Since we know that it is women who usually fared better in most of the exams, let's check the gender distribution due to the education of their parents.

</div>
```{r}
student %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = parental_education, y = exsams_avg, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha =.8) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Greens") +
  ggtitle("Gender among parental level of education group") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust =.5, size = 10),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#d1e6f0"),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, 
                                   vjust =.5, hjust = 1)
    ) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = "average of all exams") 
```
<div style="text-align: justify">

We can see, the number of women in each of these groups is greater than the number of men.  

Do you remember what the overall results were for each ethnic group? It turned out that group A was the lowest and the weakest of all five groups. It is worth noting that this group is the least common in the masters degree. Perhaps this is the reason for such high results in the rankings of this group.

</div>
```{r}
student %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = parental_education, y = exsams_avg, fill = race)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha =.8) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Paired') +                                          scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 40, to = 80, by = 20)) +
  ggtitle("Writing score") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0, 100, by = 20)) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust =.5, size = 10),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#d1e6f0"),
    legend.position = "bottom",
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, 
                               vjust =.5, hjust = 1)
    ) +
 labs(x = NULL,
      y = NULL) 
```
<center> 
### Mission completed
<div style="text-align: justify">

Whether or not someone completed the test had a very important direct or indirect influence on the final result of the exams. As it turned out so far, if someone failed to pass the test, they might have less chance of getting a high score. Let's check what exactly is characterized by this variable. Let's start with its quantitative distribution.

</div>
```{r}
student %>%
group_by(test_preparation) %>%
count() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = test_preparation, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#f22e52", alpha =.8, width =.8) +
  ggtitle("Dependence of parents' education on the result of test") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust =.5, size = 14),  
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#f0d6c2")
    ) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(n, digits = 1)), vjust = 1.6, 
            color = "white", size = 5) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL) 
```
<div style="text-align: justify">

Only just over 38% passed the full test. Let's check if the completeness of the test had a real impact on the final result of the exam. Only just over 38% rejected the full test. Let's check if the completeness of the test had a real impact on the final result of the exam.

</div>
```{r}
student %>% 
group_by(test_preparation) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(exsams_avg, fill = test_preparation)) +
  geom_density(adjust = 1, alpha =.8) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Pastel1') +   
  ggtitle("Exam result due to the completeness of the test") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust =.5, size = 10),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#f0d6c2")
    ) +
 labs(x = 'exams average',
      y = NULL) 
```
<div style="text-align: justify">

As you can see, whether someone failed the complete test significantly influenced the final result. In the chart above, you can see quite a lot of difference between the two groups. And I do it with the numbers?

</div>
```{r}
student %>%
  group_by(test_preparation) %>%
  summarise(mean_m = mean(exsams_avg)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = test_preparation, y = mean_m)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#87edac", alpha =.8, width =.8) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(mean_m, digits = 1)), 
            vjust = 1.6, color = "white", size = 5) +
  ggtitle("Average obtained from exams due to the completeness of the test") +
  theme(
     plot.title = element_text(hjust =.5, size = 10),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#f0d6c2")
  ) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = NULL) 
```
<div style="text-align: justify">

Differs the mean of all three tests to more than 7 points. It seems like quite a lot. So in the exam, you can turn strategies to complete the test, whether or not you are sure of your answer, there is a good chance that we will increase our chances of getting higher scores!

Let's also check how the students gave the tests due to the education of their parents.

| Parental education | Complete | None  | 
|:------------------:|:--------:|:-----:|
| associates degree  |  36.94% | 63.06%  | 
| bachelors degree   | 38.98%  | 61.02%  | 
| high school        | 28.57%  | 71.43%  | 
| masters degree     | 33.90%  | 66.10%  | 
| some college       | 34.07%  | 65.93%  | 
| some high school   | 43.02%  | 56.98%  | 

And what about ethnicity?

</div>
```{r}
student %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = test_preparation, y = exsams_avg)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = race), alpha =.8, notch = TRUE,
               outlier.colour = "black", outlier.shape = 21,

## Summary
<div style="text-align: justify">

Of course, on the basis of the above analysis, we are able to come to very interesting and significant conclusions. However, before going to them, I wanted to know my data even more. That's why I decided to use logistic regression for this.

I created an additional factor variable called 'student_group', which has two values: 'bad' (for students with an average of all grades below 60 points) and 'good' (for students with an average of all grades above 60 points). My regression model was to use variables such as gender, race, lunch, parental_education, and test_preparation to predict whether the student did well in the exams or not.

While the quality of my model was not that important, the regression results alone could tell us a lot. Let's check it ourselves.

</div>
<center> 
### Logistic regression results

```{r}
tidy(student_glm$finalModel) %>% 
knitr::kable()
```
<div style="text-align: justify">

As you can see, many of our hypotheses from the data analysis itself have been confirmed by the logistic regression model. First, it is obvious that only four variables are statistically significant. They are in turn

1.  Course completion grade.
2.  Forms of election financing of the lunch.
3.  Student's back.
4.  Belonging to the group E.

To confirm my words, we can still check the validity of the variables.

</div>
```{r}
varImp(student_glm)
```
<div style="text-align: justify">

Additionally, the dinner variable gives us very interesting results. Not only that it is statistically significant, to complement, looking at the results of our regression model, we can conclude that if someone is a standard option (not subsidized), he or she may have 3.5 times more chance of being in a better group than people who benefited from funding. It is really interesting!

Finally, let's consider what specific conclusions we can come to by analyzing our data in detail.

1. The greatest impact on the result obtained in the exams is followed by the parents' education (the higher the education, the better the result), the use of a subsidized lunch (if the student used this option, he usually had a lower result);

2. Looking generally at the results of both genders, women fared better, but men were definitely better on the math exam;

3. The best educated ethnic group was group E. Interestingly, women came from better educated families than men;

4. It is men who constitute the majority in group A, which fared by far the weakest in comparison with the others. Perhaps that is why men fared less well than women.
